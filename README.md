This will host your BLOG for the creation of the Freedom Project.

It will be attached to your Website and it will count as a significant portion of your grade.

There should be TWO different BLOG Types
1. Overview
2. Daily Entries


### Overview

The first is an OVERVIEW Entry - this is the Introduction, it explains the purpose of the blog, that it is documenting the freedom project (and what that is), and what you are writing about.
There is _only one_ overview entry.

*Context*
The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about _applying what we have learned in out own website creation and presenting it_.

The purpose of this blog is to _Keep record of my journey on this road_.

*Content*
For my project, I am making a website about _Serial Killers_ using Github, HTML, CSS, and(tbd

This blog will document the process of independently studying _Serial Killers_ and (tbd) and making the website.

### Daily Entries

The second type are 'daily' entries. These should be completed each time you work on the Freedom Project,
whether you are working at school or at home, on research or revision. Doesn't matter. This documents the _research_ involved in its creation.
Each week there will be a new file to hold the new Blog Entry you write on Freedom Friday. The first file should be called entry1.md.
